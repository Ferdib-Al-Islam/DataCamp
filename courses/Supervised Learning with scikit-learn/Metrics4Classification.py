/* Here, you'll work with the PIMA Indians dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes) obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to predict whether or not a given female patient will contract diabetes based on features such as BMI, age, and number of pregnancies. Therefore, it is a binary classification problem. A target value of 0 indicates that the patient does not have diabetes, while a value of 1 indicates that the patient does have diabetes. As in Chapters 1 and 2, the dataset has been preprocessed to deal with missing values.

The dataset has been loaded into a DataFrame df and the feature and target variable arrays X and y have been created for you. In addition, sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split and sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier have already been imported.

Your job is to train a k-NN classifier to the data and evaluate its performance by generating a confusion matrix and classification report.*/
# Import necessary modules
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report  
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix 

# Create training and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.4, random_state=42)

# Instantiate a k-NN classifier: knn
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)

# Fit the classifier to the training data
knn.fit(X_train, y_train) 

# Predict the labels of the test data: y_pred
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

# Generate the confusion matrix and classification report
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
