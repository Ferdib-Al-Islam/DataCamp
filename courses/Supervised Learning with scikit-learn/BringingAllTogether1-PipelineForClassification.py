/* t is time now to piece together everything you have learned so far into a pipeline for classification! Your job in this exercise is to build a pipeline that includes scaling and hyperparameter tuning to classify wine quality.

You'll return to using the SVM classifier you were briefly introduced to earlier in this chapter. The hyperparameters you will tune are C and gamma. C controls the regularization strength. It is analogous to the C you tuned for logistic regression in Chapter 3, while gamma controls the kernel coefficient: Do not worry about this now as it is beyond the scope of this course.

The following modules have been pre-loaded: Pipeline, svm, train_test_split, GridSearchCV, classification_report, accuracy_score. The feature and target variable arrays X and y have also been pre-loaded. */


# Setup the pipeline
steps = [('scaler', StandardScaler()),
         ('SVM', SVC())]

pipeline = Pipeline(steps)

# Specify the hyperparameter space
parameters = {'SVM__C':[1, 10, 100],
              'SVM__gamma':[0.1, 0.01]}

# Create train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=21)

# Instantiate the GridSearchCV object: cv
cv =  GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid=parameters)

# Fit to the training set
cv.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the labels of the test set: y_pred
y_pred = cv.predict(X_test)

# Compute and print metrics
print("Accuracy: {}".format(cv.score(X_test, y_test)))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("Tuned Model Parameters: {}".format(cv.best_params_))
