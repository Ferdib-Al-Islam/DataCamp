/*  Now that you've learned about cliques, it's time to try leveraging what you know to find structures in a network. Triangles are what you'll go for first. We may be interested in triangles because they're the simplest complex clique. Let's write a few functions; these exercises will bring you through the fundamental logic behind network algorithms.

In the Twitter network, each node has an 'occupation' label associated with it, in which the Twitter user's work occupation is divided into celebrity, politician and scientist. One potential application of triangle-finding algorithms is to find out whether users that have similar occupations are more likely to be in a clique with one another. */

def is_in_triangle(G, n):
    """
    Checks whether a node `n` in graph `G` is in a triangle relationship or not. 
    
    Returns a boolean.

    in_triangle = False
    
    # Iterate over all possible triangle relationship combinations
    for n1, n2 in combinations(G.neighbors(n), 2):
    
        # Check if an edge exists between n1 and n2
        if G.has_edge(n1, n2):
