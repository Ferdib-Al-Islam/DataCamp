/* In PySpark, joins are performed using the DataFrame method .join(). This method takes three arguments. The first is the second DataFrame that you want to join with the first one. The second argument, on, is the name of the key column(s) as a string. The names of the key column(s) must be the same in each table. The third argument, how, specifies the kind of join to perform. In this course we'll always use the value how="leftouter".

The flights dataset and a new dataset called airports are already in your workspace. */


# Examine the data
print(airports.show())

# Rename the faa column
airports = airports.withColumnRenamed("faa", "dest")

# Join the DataFrames
flights_with_airports = flights.join(airports, on="dest", how="leftouter")

# Examine the data again
print(flights_with_airports.show())
